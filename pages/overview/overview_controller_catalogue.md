summary: An overview of data controllers which are using the service
---

The purpose of the controller catalogue is to document the system suppliers and health and social care organisations authorised to share information as events using the National Events Management Service (NEMS).

Any requests to share information via NHS Digital services, the source and consumer of that information, are reviewed by the Interoperability Working Group and a recommendation provided by the group as to the appropriate sharing pattern(s) and sharing capability(ies) which meet end user needs.

The following documents make up the controller catalogue:
