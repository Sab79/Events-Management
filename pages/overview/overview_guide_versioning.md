This page outlines the versioning and maturity label attached to this specification. The maturity and stability of specific events is outlined and described on the [Supported Event Messages](overview_supported_events.html) page.

## Semantic Versioning ##

The specification uses version numbering as follows, MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH which is incremented as follows:

- MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
- MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
- PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.


## NEMS Service Maturity Label ##

The maturity label on this specification indicates the maturity of the NEMS as a service rather than an indication of the maturity of the specific specification version. The labels are taken from the GDS development process stages, and will be one of:

 - **Experimental**: Early development/POC version of an API for early sight during discovery
 - **Alpha**: Initial test APIs, likely to change substantially, or be discontinued as the project develops
 - **Beta**: APIs that are still under active development and subject to change, but that are likely to progress into a live API
 - **Release Candidate**: APIs that are largely complete, unlikely to change substantially, but still need further testing before becoming live
 - **Live**: Release live APIs
 - **Discontinued**: APIs which have been discontinued and should not be used for new development.
