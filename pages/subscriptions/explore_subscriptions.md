## Types of Subscription ##

- Rule-Based (Generic) Subscriptions
  - A rule-based subscription relates to where a subscriber wishes to view all published events that meet a particular rule set. For example, a Health Visitor system wishing to view events for all children within a specific local authority area. 
- Explicit Subscriptions
  - An explicit subscription relates to where a subscriber wishes to view events for a particular set of records, for example, a Pharmacist wishing to view Hospital admission events for a set of Patients. In this case the subscription would be for a set of NHS numbers.
