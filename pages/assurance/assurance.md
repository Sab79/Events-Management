## Onboarding

Onboarding for the NEMS starts with a provider contacting <a href="mailto:nrlnems.ls@nhs.net?subject=Events%20Management%20Service">the team</a>.

The provider will be asked about their use cases and the purpose for the information sharing, to make sure it aligns with the direction and information governance requirements of the NEMS.

Once the use case has been assessed the provider will be given an Onboarding Guide (<a href="https://github.com/nhsconnect/Events-Management/raw/Downloads/NEMS%20Onboarding%20Guide.docx" >Download Guide</a>), which outlines the onboarding and assurance steps in further detail.


## Assurance

When starting the onboarding process the provider will be given a document called the SCAL, which is used to record the conformance of the system to the requirements.

The team will detail the next steps to start the assurance process and give an overview of the requirements to use NEMS.

Further details can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/nhsconnect/Events-Management/raw/Downloads/NEMS%20Onboarding%20Guide.docx" >onboarding guide</a>.
