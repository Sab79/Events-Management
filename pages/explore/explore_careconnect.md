{% include important.html content="This site is under active development by NHS Digital and is intended to provide the FHIR messaging components for the Events Management Service. This project is being developed using an agile methodology so iterative updates to content will be added on a regular basis. It is advised not to develop against these specifications until a formal announcement has been made." %}

## Background ##
FHIR Messaging components specified within this site have been developed by NHS Digital and where applicable, use CareConnect profiles created in collaboration with the [INTEROPen](http://interopen.org) community. 

The INTEROPen vision is to create a library of nationally defined HL7® FHIR® resources and interaction patterns that implementers can adopt to simplify integration and interoperability within UK health and social care.

## Application of CareConnect STU3 FHIR profiles for Events Management Service ##

This Beta specification release adopts the following Level 2 CareConnect STU3 FHIR profiles and their supporting artefacts, which have been published following INTEROPen curation on the [HL7-UK github repository](https://github.com/HL7-UK/CareConnect-profiles-STU3/):

- CareConnect-Location-1
- CareConnect-Organization-1
- CareConnect-Patient-1
- CareConnect-Practitioner-1
- CareConnect-PractitionerRole-1


The Beta specification release also adopts the Level 2 **CareConnect-Observation-1** STU3 FHIR profile and any supporting artefacts. This has been developed by NHS Digital as part of an exercise to uplift the CareConnect DSTU2 FHIR Profiles published by INTEROPen to an STU3 equivalent, within a [feature branch](https://github.com/HL7-UK/CareConnect-profiles/tree/feature/interopen) on the [HL7-UK github repository](https://github.com/HL7-UK/CareConnect-profiles-STU3)

Level 3 profiles have been developed with reference to the INTEROPen document [Deriving-CareConnect-Profiles](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Fe6_w78BiNKwAnmsJi0-oQe7TRc2VpFqUQGpdpbkn7s/edit#heading=h.v4n7w91x36ud).
