## Event Message Content ##

The Failsafe Message Response is generated by an Organisation or Service in response to a Failsafe Message. The purpose of a Failsafe Message Response is to notify stakeholders that a task that is covered under the failsafe rules, cannot be fulfilled for a certain amount of time (for example, performing an intervention or registering with a service and the person is unavailable). Stakeholders may include the National Failsafe Management Service (NFMS) as well as other consumers. This may result in either suspending NFMS activity in evaluating a population failsafe rule, or enabling other local business processes (e.g. workflows and UI) in making the information known and available to Healthcare Professionals.

The Failsafe Message Response MUST include the identifier (CareConnect-Task-1.identifier) of the Failsafe Message that it is responding to.

All “Failsafe Message Response” event messages that are published to the NEMS MUST be created inline with guidance and requirements specified on this page and on the [Generic Event Message Requirements](explore_generic_event_requirements.html) page.

## Bundle Structure ##

## Failsafe Message Response Event Message Types ##

The Failsafe Message Response will be sent by an organisation or service in response to a Failsafe Message. The Failsafe Message Response event message type should be the “equivalent” to the Failsafe Message being responded to.

## Event Life Cycle ##

The MessageHeader resource contains the messageEventType extension which represents the action to be taken at a resource level, for example, whether the Failsafe Message Response being shared is new or has been updated, or the Failsafe Message Response is to be deleted. The messageEventType extension shall contain a value as per the table below:

| Value  | Description                                                                                      |
|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| new    | The new value must be used when the Failsafe Message Response is being shared for the first time |
| update | The update value must be used when an amendment to the Failsafe Message Response is being shared |
| delete | The delete value must be used when the Failsafe Message Response record has been withdrawn       |

## Identifying Information ##

To support the event life cycle outlined above the following requirements MUST be followed:
*	For new and update messageEventTypes, all Failsafe Message Response information MUST be included within the messages.
*	For update and delete message EventTypes, the same Task identifier MUST be used (in CareConnect-Task-1.identifier) as was used in the original NEW message AND the original Failsafe Message identifier quoted (in CareConnect-Task-1.groupIdentifier – see below).Only the originator of the Failsafe Message Response can send an update or delete to a given Failsafe Message Response
*	The information included in the Failsafe Message Response event message should be treated as atomic and stored under the identifier included within

## Resource Population Requirements and Guidance ##

The following requirements and resource population guidance should be followed in addition to the requirements and guidance outlined in the Generic Requirements page.
