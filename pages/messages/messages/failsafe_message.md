---


## Event Message Content

The Failsafe Message is generated by the National Failsafe Management Service (NFMS) once a trigger condition in the NFMS has been met, e.g. a NFMS rule evaluation indicates an expected intervention has not happened. The Failsafe message is carried within the event message as specified in the guidance on this page

## Bundle Structure

Specifies mandatory referencing within the Event Message Bundle.

The diagram below shows the referencing between FHIR resources within the event message bundle:

<div style="text-align:center; margin-bottom:20px" >
	<a href="images/messages/failsafe_message.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/messages/failsafe_message.png"></a>
</div>

## Event Life Cycle ##

For the Failsafe Message the messageEventType will always be set to “new”

## Onward Delivery ##

The delivery of the Failsafe Message to subscribers via MESH will use the following WorkflowID within the MESH control file. This WorkflowID will need to be added to the receiving MESH mailbox configuration before event messages can be received. 


| Event type | Workflow Group | Workflow ID |
| Failsafe Message GP | FAILSAFE_MESSAGE_GP | FAILSAFEMESSAGEGP_1 |
| Failsafe Message HVS | FAILSAFE_MESSAGE _HVS | FAILSAFEMESSAGEHVS_1 |
| Failsafe Message Bloodspot Outcome | FAILSAFE_MESSAGE _BLOODSPOT_OUTCOME | FAILSAFEMESSAGEBLOODSPOTOUTCOME_1 |
| Failsafe Message NIPE Newborn | FAILSAFE_MESSAGE _NIPE_NEWBORN | FAILSAFEMESSAGENIPENEWBORN_1 |
| Failsafe Message Newborn Hearing | FAILSAFE_MESSAGE_NEWBORN_HEARING | FAILSAFEMESSAGENEWBORNHEARING_1 |

## Resource Population Requirements and Guidance ##

The following requirements and resource population guidance should be followed in addition to the requirements and guidance outlined in the Generic Requirements page.

If Failsafe has a code to indicate the element has not been   complete, then this should be used in thevalueCodeableConcept. Where there is   no data in Failsafe, then the <text> element of   the valueCodeableConcept should be used to convey this. For example for a   NIPE examination one of “Hips element not received” “Eyes element not received” “Heart element not received” “Testes element not received”  |
