## Introduction ##

The Events Management Service (EMS) Specification supports the following communications:

- **Events Management Service** including the EMS Event Message Response.
- **National Failsafe** this event message is intended to support both population tracking and population screening. It will alert parents and professionals if the standard programme of care is not delivered or undertaken as expected.
- **Patient Demographics Service (PDS) Updates** these event messages will issue updates made to demographic information held by the PDS.
- **[Digital Child Health](https://developer.nhs.uk/library/interoperability/digital-child-health/)** event messages containing information meaningful to those managing the personal health of themselves or their families, professionals providing direct care to children and young people and those managing the health of populations.
